- Hi, I am Nakul, currently working as data scientist and a consulting associate at Charles Rivers Associates. I finished my PhD in Neuroscience at Weill Cornell/Rockefeller University.
- I published my thesis in the journal Nature, where I showed how hippocampal circuits drive memory formation and learning, but distributed feature representations of these memories in the cortical circuits act as pointers to the conjunctive memory representations in the hippocapus during memory retrieval in organisms. 
- Additionally, I also collaborated on multiple projects for neural data analysis, in particular, multi-region interactions during learning and consolidation of memories, how synchronized circuits in the brain drive working memory, and how genetic perturbation influence neural dynamics in the brain.
- Before that, I trained in engineering physics in my undergrad, where I took theoretical physics and engineering courses.
- Building models of brain driven by interacting brain regions driving behaviors 
- Now, I work as a data scientist and a consulting associate in life science practice, delivering data driven solutions to healtchare companies, and tryng to simplify the complicated healthcare infrastructure.
